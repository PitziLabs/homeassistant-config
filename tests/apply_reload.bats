# Unit tests for apply_reload() in scripts/gitops-sync.sh.
#
# apply_reload() is the smart-routing decision tree the GitOps loop uses to pick
# the lightest safe reload for a given change set (dashboards -> themes ->
# automations -> scripts -> scenes -> full restart, with no-op and fallback
# cases). It is pure path-matching logic with no HA dependency, so it can be
# exercised in isolation by sourcing the script and stubbing its side-effecting
# helpers (log / ha_call_service / ha_core_restart / ha_notify) plus `git diff`.
#
# Each stub appends a token to $CALLS_FILE; tests assert on the recorded calls.
